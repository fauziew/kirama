# Kirama Gamelan Simulator

Kirama is a Gamelan Simulator that can be used to study music without actual instruments. 
It allows computer keyboard keys to be mapped to sounds with adjustable frequencies. 
Therefore it simplifies the creation of microtonal sounds, which is an inherent feature of gamelan ensembles.
